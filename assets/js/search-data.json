            "content": "Introduction . &quot;Why quantum mechanics? And why turbulence? - Werner Heisenberg&quot; . Modes of climate variability . Atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and continental hydrology exchange mass, momentum, and energy causing fluctuations in global- or regional-scale climate variables, such as sea surface temperature (SST), precipitation, and sea surface pressure (Viron et al., 2013). Time scales of these fluctuations vary from days to centennials and can be summarized as modes of climate variability. Identifying climate modes helps to understand our climate system. They simplify high-dimensional systems and provide a better predictive capacity (Wang et al., 2003). According to the World Meteorological Organization the average weather, better known as climate, is defined as periods longer than 30 years. Hence, the term climate variability aims at explaining variations in the mean state and other statistics of the climate &quot;on all spatial and temporal scales beyond that of individual weather events&quot; (IPCC, 2013). Examples of climate variability can be found throughout time:During the last 500,000 years there were only four full glacial cycles, caused by changes to the Earth&#39;s orbital parameters. The last glacial period (115,000 BP - 11,700 BP) was characterized by strong temperature variations while the past 10,000 years have seen more constant temperatures. The past 1,000 years were dominated by a warm period from the 11$^{th}$ to the 13$^{th}$ century, followed by a cold period from the 16$^{th}$ to the 19$^{th}$ century. These periods are commonly known as the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and the Little Ice Age (LIA; Mann et al., 2006). Regional patterns of climate are typically much more variable than global climate, and the involved time scales are shorter. Regional climate modes are found by decomposing the spatio-temporal variability of the atmosphere or the ocean into spatial patterns that change in magnitude over time. While some modes affect the climate of large parts of the Earth, others have smaller-scale effects, affecting only local climate conditions. It is striking how some climate modes affect the weather halfway across the globe. These long-distance effects are called teleconnections. The most prominent climate mode, the so called El Nino / Southern Oscillation (ENSO), is associated with SST changes in the central equatorial Pacific Ocean. It affects weather all over the globe from Peru to North America and from Australia to east Africa. If climate modes and their teleconnections are interpreted correctly, the predictability of regional climate conditions can be increased. However, one difficulty regarding reliable predictions is that the temporal variability of a climate mode can change stochastically. Further, the effect of one climate mode can be either compensated for or enhanced by another climate mode. Another difficulty is that the temporal variability of climate modes can be affected by the interaction between two modes. Therefore, when studying regional climate, it is necessary to understand how relevant climate modes interact. In the following, two dominant modes of the climate of the Northern Hemisphere are introduced; First, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and second, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). In addition, current research results on how they influence European climate and the Baltic Sea region are discussed. . North Atlantic Oscillation . During winter the most dominant and recurrent mode of climate variability in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) is the NAO. The NAO is primarily an atmospheric phenomenon and is characterized by a sea level pressure (SLP) difference between the subpolar low-pressure system near Iceland (Icelandic Low) and the subtropical anticyclone in the Atlantic near the Azores citep[Azores High;][]{introduction-nao}. The spatial pattern of the NAO is shown in Figure ref{fig:nao}. It can be seen that in the case of ECHO-G the NAO accounts for 38.17 % of the SLP variability in the model domain. . There are several ways to define the NAO. One way is the winter SLP difference between Lisbon and Reykjavik citep[e.g.][]{jones1997}. A more advanced approach is the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis (see Figure ref{fig:nao}). A detailed description of this method is given in autoref{chap:data_and_methods}. The underlying idea of this linear concept is to find atmospheric patterns that fluctuate between positive and negative states, which applies to the NAO. .
